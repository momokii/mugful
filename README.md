# Mugful

A private, playful web space for adults in long-distance relationships. The first release focuses on one shared activity: **Guess My Answer**.

> **Status:** Product and architecture confirmed. Application implementation has not started yet.

## Product direction

Two partners create or join one private couple space. Either partner can start a curated prompt round, answer privately, and reveal both answers together after both have submitted. The experience works asynchronously and becomes more lively when both partners are online.

v1 deliberately does **not** include native video, AI, behavioral analytics, or multiple activities. Those are documented future milestones rather than unfinished promises.

## Technology direction

- Next.js + React + TypeScript web app.
- Fastify + TypeScript modular API/realtime backend.
- pnpm workspaces + Turborepo monorepo.
- PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM.
- REST JSON + OpenAPI for commands.
- Socket.IO for presence and post-commit events.
- TanStack Query for server-state caching.
- Docker Compose for development, testing, and VPS deployment.
- Separate public Docker Hub web/API images with semantic-version and commit-SHA tags.

## Current repository state

This repository currently contains the confirmed product, architecture, design-system, privacy, SMTP, roadmap, and contributor documentation. There is no runnable application yet, so application commands will be added when implementation begins.

## Open-source principles

The source repository is intended to be public from its first commit. Do not commit secrets, real user data, private keys, production environment files, or unredacted operational logs. Apache-2.0 applies to the project; see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE).

## Deployment promise

The finished v1 will provide documented Docker Compose configurations and a single deployment entry point for a personal VPS. The deployment documentation will cover environment validation, Docker Hub authentication, Traefik integration points, migrations, backups, health checks, rollback, and external SMTP setup.

## Privacy boundary

The app is designed around Indonesian UU PDP principles and an application-level privacy boundary. Superadmins can manage operational metadata but cannot read private couple content through normal application interfaces. This is not the same as end-to-end encryption; E2EE is future work.

## License

Apache-2.0. Contributions are welcome once the implementation begins and must preserve the product’s privacy, security, accessibility, and documentation requirements.
